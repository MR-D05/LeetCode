# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - 'release/**'
    - 'hotfix/**'

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:

    - name: Extract branch name
      id: vars
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo "##[set-output name=branch;]$(echo ${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/})"
        echo "::set-output name=sha_short::$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
    
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Checkout develop branch
      run: git fetch && git checkout develop

    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    - name: Merge branch into develop
      run: git merge origin/${{ steps.vars.outputs.branch }} && git push origin develop
